1) Copy the Google Sheet ["Desc Stats-1"]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1veZLXKJM1JByk6Iscfuy0OQGIvIUy4z3-4AHt4PjaZ8/edit?usp=share_link ) to your own Google Drive and name it "Desc Stats-1"
2) To the right of "Calc Mean =>" ( cell B1 ), use the =AVERAGE() function to calculate the average ( i.e. mean ) of all the values under the "Samples" field
3) To the right of "Count =>" ( cell B2 ), enter a formula to count the number of values under the "Samples" field
4) To the right of "Sum =>" ( cell B3 ), enter a formula to add up the values under the "Samples" field
5) To the right of "Mean =>" ( cell B4 ), enter a formula to divide the "Count" by the "Sum", i.e. calculate the mean. This number should equal the "Calc Mean".

See ["Desc Stats-1.sample"]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJrEsDjoz-jHYv3YN7I4IrvCjqkdUM-y-ONiRtD6P1c/edit?usp=share_link ) to check your work.
