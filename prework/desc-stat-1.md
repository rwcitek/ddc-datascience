# Descriptive statistics - 1
1) copy the Google Sheet "Desc Stats-1" to your own Google Drive and name it "Desc Stats-1"
2) to the right of "Calc Mean =>" ( cell B1 ), use the =AVERAGE() function to calculate the average ( i.e. mean ) of all the values under the "Samples" field
3) to the right of "Count =>" ( cell B2 ), enter a formula to count the number of values under the "Samples" field
4) to the right of "Sum =>" ( cell B3 ), enter a formula to add up the values under the "Samples" field
5) to the right of "Mean =>" ( cell B4 ), enter a formula to divide the "Count" by the "Sum", i.e. calculate the mean. This number should equal the "Calc Mean".

See "Desc Stats-1.sample" to check your work.
