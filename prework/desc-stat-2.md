# Descriptive statistics - 2
1) Copy the Google Sheet ["Desc Stats-2"]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SjeCC5WkBlnX3tHD5kQ98e3iITLMGrot5H0HHUNXCRo/edit?usp=share_link ) to your own Google Drive and name it "Desc Stats-2"
2) Under the "Delta" field, subtract the Mean ( cell B3 ) from each value in the "Samples" field
3) Under the "Delta Squared" field, enter a formula to square each value from the "Delta" field
4) To the right of "Calc StdDev =>" ( cell D1 ), use the =STDEVA() function on the "Samples" field to calculate the Sample Standard Deviation
5) To the right of "Sum Delta Squared =>" ( cell D2 ), enter a formula to sum all the values under the "Delta Squared" field
6) To the right of "Mean Sum Delta Squared =>" ( cell D3 ), enter a formula to divide the "Sum Delta Squared" by one less than the Count ( cell B1 )
7) To the right of the "Sample Standard Deviation =>" ( cell D3 ), enter a formula to take the square root of "Mean Sum Delta Squared".  This number should equal the "Calc StdDev".

See ["Desc Stats-2.sample"]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M55xOsI2qi8F6W0BkauLxMuXJxfrDEqufBiuS57oba8/edit?usp=share_link ) to check your work.
This is a sample of the sheet showing the results of the calculations, but only the first ten values of the Samples data set.
