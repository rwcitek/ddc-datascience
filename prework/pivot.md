# Pivot table
1) Copy the Google Sheet ["Pivot DS"]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1upsKYy0AJuyN_bJX1EXHiys1ONwZihD_aQpdH22nGe0/edit?usp=share_link ) to your own Google Drive and name it "Pivot DS"
2) Insert a blank column to the left of "Project" and name it "ID"
3) Fill in the "ID" rows with numbers starting at 1
4) Insert a blank column between "Year" and "Month" and name it "Quarter"
5) Compute the "Quarter" for each row.  The first three months of the year are in the first quarter, the next three months are in the second quarter, and so on.
6) Answer the question "What was the total amount for Projected Budget per quarter per project per year?" by creating a pivot table in a new sheet. Name the sheet "Pivot-1".  Create it with the following:
      - rows: Year, Project, Quarter
      - value: Projected Budget
7) Answer the question "What was the average amount for Actual Budget per project per year?" by creating a pivot table in a new sheet. Name the sheet "Pivot-2".  Create it with the following:
      - rows: Project
      - columns: Year
      - value: Actual Budget ( Average )
